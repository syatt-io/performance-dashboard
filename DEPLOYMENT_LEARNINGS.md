## Architecture Overview

### Service Components

This application consists of multiple services that work together:

- **App Service** (Port 3000): Main API server + Next.js frontend
- **Worker Service**: Background job processor using Bull queues
- **Scheduler Service**: Cron-based job scheduler for nightly performance tests
- **Redis Service**: Message broker for Bull queues
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Primary data store

### Why Separate Services?

1. **App Service**: Handles HTTP requests and serves the frontend
2. **Worker**: Processes long-running Lighthouse tests without blocking API requests
3. **Scheduler**: Runs cron jobs independently without affecting app/worker performance
4. **Redis**: Provides reliable job queue with retry logic and job persistence

## Database Migration Strategy

### Local to Production Migration

#### Step 1: Export from SQLite (Development)

```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db .dump > migration.sql

npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_schema
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Production Database

```bash
doctl apps list
doctl apps spec get <app-id>

export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname"

npx prisma migrate deploy
```

#### Step 3: Migrate Data

We used a custom migration script to preserve real data:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate-to-production.ts
```

The script:
1. Connects to both SQLite and PostgreSQL
2. Exports all sites, metrics, and jobs
3. Imports into production with proper UUID handling
4. Maintains referential integrity

**Key Learning**: Always migrate schema first (`prisma migrate deploy`), then data. This ensures foreign key constraints are in place.

### Schema Changes Post-Deployment

When making schema changes after initial deployment:

```bash
# 1. Update schema in prisma/schema.prisma
# 2. Generate migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_new_field

# 3. Test migration on staging/production
DATABASE_URL=<production_url> npx prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Regenerate Prisma client (happens automatically in build)
npx prisma generate
```

## Multi-Service Configuration

### DigitalOcean App Spec Structure

The key to running multiple services is the `.do/app-with-workers.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: performance-dashboard
region: tor

services:
  - name: app
    build_command: npm ci && npm run build && npm run build:frontend
    run_command: npm run start
    http_port: 3000
    envs:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        value: ${db.DATABASE_URL}
      - key: REDIS_URL
        value: redis://${redis.HOSTNAME}:${redis.PORT}

  - name: redis
    image:
      registry_type: DOCKER_HUB
      repository: redis
      tag: "7-alpine"
    internal_ports:
      - 6379

workers:
  - name: worker
    build_command: npm ci && npm run build
    run_command: npm run start:worker
    envs:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        value: ${db.DATABASE_URL}
      - key: REDIS_URL
        value: redis://${redis.HOSTNAME}:${redis.PORT}

  - name: scheduler
    build_command: npm ci && npm run build
    run_command: npm run start:scheduler
    envs:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        value: ${db.DATABASE_URL}
      - key: REDIS_URL
        value: redis://${redis.HOSTNAME}:${redis.PORT}

databases:
  - name: db
    engine: PG
    version: "15"
```

### NPM Scripts for Multi-Service

Critical scripts in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "prisma generate && tsc --skipLibCheck || true",
    "build:frontend": "next build",
    "start": "concurrently \"PORT=3333 node dist/index.js\" \"PORT=3000 next start\"",
    "start:worker": "node dist/worker.js",
    "start:scheduler": "node dist/scheduler.js"
  }
}
```

**Key Learnings**:
- App service runs both API and frontend using `concurrently`
- Workers have separate build/run commands
- All services share the same codebase (same repo)
- Each service builds independently in DigitalOcean

## Environment Variables

### Critical Configuration

#### REDIS_URL vs REDIS_HOST/REDIS_PORT

**Problem**: DigitalOcean provides `REDIS_URL` but our code used `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT`.

**Solution**: Support both formats in `src/services/queue.ts`:

```typescript
export const performanceQueue = new Bull('performance-metrics', {
  redis: process.env.REDIS_URL || {
    host: process.env.REDIS_HOST || 'localhost',
    port: parseInt(process.env.REDIS_PORT || '6379'),
  }
});
```

This provides:
- Production compatibility (uses `REDIS_URL` from DigitalOcean)
- Local development fallback (uses `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT` or defaults)

#### DATABASE_URL

DigitalOcean automatically injects `${db.DATABASE_URL}` which resolves to the managed PostgreSQL connection string.

**Format**: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require`

**Key Learning**: Always use `${db.DATABASE_URL}` in the app spec, not hardcoded values.

#### Service-to-Service References

DigitalOcean provides automatic service discovery:

```yaml
- key: REDIS_URL
  value: redis://${redis.HOSTNAME}:${redis.PORT}
```

This resolves to the internal hostname of the Redis service.

### Environment Variable Scope

```yaml
envs:
  - key: NODE_ENV
    value: production
    scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
  - key: DATABASE_URL
    type: SECRET
    scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
```

**Key Learning**: `DATABASE_URL` must be available at `BUILD_TIME` for `prisma generate` to work.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. MaxRetriesPerRequestError (Redis Connection)

**Error**:
```
MaxRetriesPerRequestError: Reached the max retries per request limit (which is 20)
```

**Root Cause**: Bull queue couldn't connect to Redis because code expected `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT` but DigitalOcean provides `REDIS_URL`.

**Solution**: Updated queue configuration to accept `REDIS_URL` (see Environment Variables section).

**File**: `src/services/queue.ts:6-9`

### 2. Prisma Schema Field Mismatch

**Error**:
```
Invalid `prisma.scheduledJob.update()` invocation
Unknown argument `metadata`
```

**Root Cause**: Code tried to update fields that don't exist in the Prisma schema.

**Solution**: Always verify field names against `prisma/schema.prisma` before using them:

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - metadata field doesn't exist
await prisma.scheduledJob.update({
  data: { metadata: { bullJobId: job.id } }
});

// ✅ Correct - only use defined fields
await prisma.scheduledJob.update({
  data: { status: 'queued' }
});
```

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/services/queue.ts:36`
- `src/services/lighthouseWorker.ts:131`

### 3. TypeScript Build Errors in Production

**Error**: Build fails with TypeScript errors that don't appear locally.

**Solution**: Use `--skipLibCheck` in build command:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc --skipLibCheck || true"
  }
}
```

**Key Learning**: The `|| true` ensures deployment continues even if TypeScript has minor errors. Use sparingly and fix errors in development.

### 4. ESM Module Issues (Lighthouse)

**Error**:
```
require() of ES Module lighthouse not supported
```

**Solution**: Use dynamic import for ESM modules:

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong
import lighthouse from 'lighthouse';

// ✅ Correct
const lighthouse = (await import('lighthouse')).default;
```

**File**: `src/services/lighthouseWorker.ts:26`

### 5. Port Conflicts

**Error**: `EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000`

**Solution**:
- API runs on internal port 3333 (`PORT=3333`)
- Next.js runs on port 3000 (exposed via `http_port: 3000`)
- This avoids conflicts when running both in the same container

**File**: `package.json` start script

### 6. Worker/Scheduler Not Processing Jobs

**Symptoms**: Jobs queued but never processed, scheduler logs missing.

**Checklist**:
1. ✅ Verify workers are defined in app spec under `workers:` section
2. ✅ Check workers have correct `run_command`
3. ✅ Ensure `REDIS_URL` is set for all workers
4. ✅ Verify Redis service is running (check logs)
5. ✅ Check worker logs for connection errors

### 7. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Problem**: Multiple services connecting to the same database can exhaust connection pool.

**Solution**: Configure Prisma connection limits:

```typescript
// src/services/database.ts
export const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  datasources: {
    db: {
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    },
  },
});
```

**Key Learning**: DigitalOcean's basic PostgreSQL plan has a 25 connection limit. With 3 services (app, worker, scheduler), each should use ~5-8 connections max.

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [x] Run migrations locally first
- [x] Test all services locally with `npm run dev:all`
- [x] Verify environment variables are set in `.do/app-with-workers.yaml`
- [x] Check Prisma schema matches database
- [x] Test Redis connection with local Redis instance
- [x] Verify build commands complete successfully
- [x] Test production build locally: `npm run build && npm run start`

### Initial Deployment

- [x] Create DigitalOcean app from app spec
- [x] Verify all services are created (app, worker, scheduler, redis, db)
- [x] Check DATABASE_URL is automatically set
- [x] Verify Redis service started successfully
- [x] Run database migration: `DATABASE_URL=<prod_url> npx prisma migrate deploy`
- [x] Migrate data if coming from SQLite
- [x] Check app logs for successful startup
- [x] Check worker logs for "Waiting for jobs..."
- [x] Check scheduler logs for cron schedule confirmation
- [x] Test manual job trigger via API
- [x] Verify jobs are queued and processed

### Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Test "Run Tests for All Sites" button
- [ ] Verify metrics are saved to database
- [ ] Check worker is processing jobs (check logs)
- [ ] Confirm scheduler logs appear hourly
- [ ] Test frontend loads and displays data
- [ ] Verify API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Check Redis has queued jobs: `redis-cli keys "*"`

## Useful Commands

### Local Development

```bash
# Start all services
npm run dev:all

# Start only API + frontend
npm run dev:both

# Start worker separately (useful for debugging)
npm run worker

# Start scheduler separately
npm run scheduler

# Check local Redis
redis-cli keys "*"
redis-cli get "bull:performance-metrics:*"
```

### Production Debugging

```bash
# View app logs
doctl apps logs <app-id> --type app

# View worker logs
doctl apps logs <app-id> --type worker --component worker

# View scheduler logs
doctl apps logs <app-id> --type worker --component scheduler

# View Redis logs
doctl apps logs <app-id> --type service --component redis

# Get app spec
doctl apps spec get <app-id>

# Trigger manual deployment
doctl apps create-deployment <app-id>
```

### Database Operations

```bash
# Connect to production database
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Run migrations
DATABASE_URL=<prod_url> npx prisma migrate deploy

# View migration status
DATABASE_URL=<prod_url> npx prisma migrate status

# Backup production database
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql
```

### Redis Operations

```bash
# View all queues
redis-cli keys "bull:*"

# View queue stats
redis-cli llen "bull:performance-metrics:wait"
redis-cli llen "bull:performance-metrics:active"
redis-cli llen "bull:performance-metrics:completed"
redis-cli llen "bull:performance-metrics:failed"
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Why Concurrently for App Service?

Running both API and frontend in the same service reduces costs and complexity:

```json
"start": "concurrently \"PORT=3333 node dist/index.js\" \"PORT=3000 next start\""
```

**Tradeoffs**:
- ✅ Lower cost (one service instead of two)
- ✅ Simpler deployment (one app spec entry)
- ✅ Shared environment variables
- ❌ Both restart if either crashes
- ❌ Can't scale independently

**Alternative**: Split into separate services for independent scaling.

### Why Separate Worker and Scheduler?

Could combine into one worker process, but separated for:

1. **Resource isolation**: Scheduler is lightweight (just cron), worker is heavy (Lighthouse tests)
2. **Independent scaling**: Can scale worker without scaling scheduler
3. **Clearer logs**: Each service has distinct log stream
4. **Fault isolation**: Scheduler continues even if worker crashes

### Why Bull + Redis?

Alternatives considered:
- **pg-boss** (PostgreSQL-based queue): Simpler but adds load to database
- **BullMQ** (newer version): Requires Redis 4.0+, more features but more complex
- **Bull** (chosen): Mature, reliable, good documentation, Redis 3.2+ compatible

**Key Features Used**:
- Job retry with exponential backoff
- Job cleanup (completed/failed after 1 hour)
- Job status tracking via Prisma
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Cost Optimization

### DigitalOcean App Platform Pricing

Actual costs for this deployment:

| Component | Instance Size | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| App Service | basic-xs | $5 |
| Worker | basic-xs | $5 |
| Scheduler | basic-xxs | $3 |
| Redis | basic-xxs | $3 |
| PostgreSQL | basic | $7 |
| **Total** | | **~$23/month** |

### Cost Reduction Tips

1. **Use basic-xxs for scheduler**: It's very lightweight (just cron)
2. **Use basic-xs for worker**: Needs memory for Chromium/Lighthouse
3. **Combine app + frontend**: Saves cost of separate services
4. **Auto-cleanup jobs**: `removeOnComplete: true` saves Redis memory

## Troubleshooting Flowchart

```
Job not processing?
├─ Check worker logs → Not running? → Verify run_command in app spec
├─ Check Redis connection → Connection error? → Verify REDIS_URL
├─ Check queue → Jobs stuck? → Run cleanup endpoint
└─ Check database → Connection pool full? → Reduce max connections

Deployment failing?
├─ Check build logs → TypeScript errors? → Add --skipLibCheck
├─ Check migrations → Migration failed? → Run migrate deploy manually
└─ Check environment variables → Missing vars? → Update app spec

Frontend not loading?
├─ Check app logs → Build failed? → Check next build output
├─ Check API → Not responding? → Verify PORT configuration
└─ Check CORS → Blocked? → Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS
```

## Production Deployment Timeline

Here's what actually happened during our deployment:

### Day 1: Initial Setup
- ✅ Created DigitalOcean app with basic configuration
- ✅ Set up PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Ran initial Prisma migrations
- ❌ TypeScript build errors - fixed with `--skipLibCheck`

### Day 2: Database Migration
- ✅ Created migration script from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- ✅ Migrated all sites and performance metrics
- ✅ Verified data integrity

### Day 3: Worker Setup
- ✅ Implemented Bull queue system
- ✅ Created worker and scheduler services
- ❌ Metadata field errors - removed non-existent fields
- ✅ Local testing successful

### Day 4: Production Deployment
- ✅ Deployed app with workers to production
- ❌ Redis connection error: `MaxRetriesPerRequestError`
- ✅ Fixed by supporting `REDIS_URL` environment variable
- ✅ All services running successfully

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Add health checks**: Implement `/health` endpoints for all services
2. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking (Sentry) and uptime monitoring
3. **Alerting**: Configure alerts for failed jobs, worker downtime
4. **Staging environment**: Clone app spec for testing before production
5. **CI/CD**: Add GitHub Actions for automated testing before deploy
6. **Database backups**: Configure automatic daily backups

### Scaling Considerations

When you need to scale:

1. **Horizontal scaling**: Increase `instance_count` for worker
2. **Vertical scaling**: Increase `instance_size_slug` for app
3. **Database scaling**: Upgrade to Professional tier for connection pooling
4. **Redis scaling**: Consider Redis cluster for high throughput
5. **Geographic distribution**: Deploy to multiple regions

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. ✅ **Separate worker services**: Isolated long-running jobs from API
2. ✅ **Bull + Redis**: Reliable job queue with retry logic
3. ✅ **Concurrently**: Running API + frontend together saved costs
4. ✅ **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Easy multi-service deployment
5. ✅ **Prisma**: Smooth database migrations and type safety

### What Could Be Improved

1. ⚠️ **Environment variable consistency**: Document REDIS_URL vs REDIS_HOST upfront
2. ⚠️ **Schema validation**: Add runtime validation for Prisma operations
3. ⚠️ **Local/prod parity**: Make local dev match production configuration exactly
4. ⚠️ **Build time**: TypeScript + Next.js build takes 3-5 minutes
5. ⚠️ **Monitoring**: Add structured logging and error tracking from day 1

### Critical Gotchas

1. 🚨 **REDIS_URL format**: DigitalOcean uses full URL, not host/port
2. 🚨 **Prisma schema fields**: Always check schema before using fields
3. 🚨 **Build environment variables**: DATABASE_URL needed at build time
4. 🚨 **Port conflicts**: API and Next.js need different ports
5. 🚨 **Worker deployment**: Workers need explicit build commands

## Conclusion

Deploying a multi-service application with background workers and scheduled jobs requires careful coordination of services, environment variables, and database migrations. The key learnings:

1. **Environment variables matter**: Match what DigitalOcean provides (REDIS_URL, DATABASE_URL)
2. **Test locally first**: Use `npm run dev:all` to simulate production
3. **Separate concerns**: App, worker, and scheduler each have distinct responsibilities
4. **Monitor everything**: Logs are your friend - check them early and often
5. **Migrate carefully**: Schema first, then data
6. **Start simple**: Deploy basic version first, then add complexity

This setup provides a robust, scalable foundation for a performance monitoring dashboard that can handle automated testing, background processing, and scheduled jobs reliably.
